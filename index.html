TRA provides advanced software and consulting for use of the inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) in industrial and research structural health monitoring (SHM) programs.  The iFEM software is implemented as a user-defined shell element (UEL) within the ABAQUS /Standard finite element program and runs as a batch application using a standard ABAQUS execution procedure. Auxiliary stand-alone programs are also provided for the pre-processing of input data and the post-processing of results.
The iFEM-TRA software is owned and maintained by Tessler Research Associates, LLC (TRA), located in Yorktown, Virginia, U.S.A. The software is fully operational, and its capabilities have been successfully validated using an extensive set of test cases.

          The iFEM high fidelity computational technology is essential for assessing real-time shape sensing, internal loads, and structural integrity. iFEM can also be used to provide
				feedback to the actuation and control systems of the next generation of morphed aerospace vehicles and structures.
