Structural health management systems, which by way of real-time monitoring
help mitigate accidents due to structural failures, will become integral
technologies of the next-generation aerospace vehicles. Advanced sensor arrays
and signal processing technologies are utilized to provide optimally distributed
in-situ sensor information related to the states of strain, temperature, and
aerodynamic pressure. To process the massive quantities of measured data and to
infer physically admissible structural behavior requires robust and computationally
efficient physics-based algorithms.


The inverse problem of real-time reconstruction of full-field structural displacements,
strains, and stresses is addressed using an inverse finite element method based on shear
deformable shell finite element technology. Utilizing surface strain measurements from
strain sensors mounted on load-carrying structural components, the methodology enables
accurate computations of the three-dimensional displacement field for a general built-up
shell structure undergoing multi-axial deformations. The strain and stress computations
are then carried out at the element level using strain-displacement and constitutive
relations. This high fidelity computational technology is essential for providing
feedback to the actuation and control systems of the next generation of aerospace vehicles,
and for assessing real-time internal loads and structural integrity.
